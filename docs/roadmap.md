## ðŸ§­ Roadmap

### 1. **Foundations**

* Image representations (RGB, grayscale, etc.)
* Color spaces and transformations
* Image filtering and convolutions
* Edge detection (Sobel, Canny)
* Histograms and thresholding

### 2. **Classic Computer Vision**

* Contour detection and shape analysis
* Morphological operations
* Feature detection (SIFT, ORB)
* Optical flow
* Image segmentation (thresholding, watershed)
* Object tracking (Kalman filter, MeanShift, CamShift)

### 3. **Deep Learning for Vision**

* Image classification with CNNs
* Object detection (YOLO, Faster R-CNN)
* Semantic and instance segmentation (U-Net, Mask R-CNN)
* Keypoint detection and pose estimation

### 4. **Vision Transformers**

* ViT basics
* Detection with DETR
* Hybrid CNN-ViT models

### 5. **Multi-modal Vision + Language**

* CLIP and zero-shot classification
* BLIP / GIT for image captioning
* Grounding DINO and OWL-ViT for open-vocabulary detection
* Vision-Language models for retrieval and reasoning

### 6. **Generative AI for Vision**

* Image generation (Stable Diffusion, DALLÂ·E)
* Inpainting and super-resolution
* Image-to-image translation
* Video generation from prompts
